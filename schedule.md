# Schedule

## Week 1

### Tuesday, September 3

First day of class.

### Thursday, September 5

- Introductory discussion.
- Presentation by Teaching Fellow Raffi Sanna.

## Week 2

### Tuesday, September 10

We set the schedule for the course.

### Thursday, September 12

TBD

## Week 3

### Tuesday, September 17

Tutorial on implementing Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus (STLC) with iso-recursive types from formal semantics.

We will consider languages (paradigms) like Dafny (verified functional programming), miniKanren (relational programming), Coq (proof assistant), Idris (dependent types).

We will consider techniques for reasoning about binders, for defining operational semantics (small step vs big step), for representing functions/closures (first order vs higher order).

Preparation homework: read up on STLC and iso-recursive types. TAPL is a good source for both. TODO: Before class, I will provide the formal semantics for STLC with iso-recursive types, as a PDF and as LaTeX maybe.


### Thursday, September 19

Survey on techniques for reasoning about binders and scope, theoretically and practically.

Challenges include quotienting modulo alpha-equivalence, implementing capture-avoiding substitution, handling shadowing.

Techniques include nominal logic, higher-orde abstract syntax (HOAS), de Bruijn index, locally nameless, combinatory logic (which avoids variables entirely).

Preparation homework: dive into a specific technique, and be ready to share insights and code snippets.
