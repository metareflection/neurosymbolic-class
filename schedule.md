## Week 3

### Tuesday, September 17

Tutorial on implementing Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus (STLC) with iso-recursive types from formal semantics.

We will consider languages (paradigms) like Dafny (verified functional programming), miniKanren (relational programming), Coq (proof assistant), Idris (dependent types).

We will consider techniques for reasoning about binders, for defining operational semantics (small step vs big step), for representing functions/closures (first order vs higher order).

Homework: read up on STLC and iso-recursive types. TAPL is a good source for both. TODO: Before class, I will provide the formal semantics for STLC with iso-recursive types, as a PDF and as LaTeX maybe.
