# Neurosymbolic Programming

The topic for CS2520R Fall 2025 is Neurosymbolic Programming. We will examine how systems combining both neural and symbolic components can learn to synthesize and evaluate formal logic proofs, constraint satisfaction problems, and programs while preserving syntax and semantics with both hard and probabilistic guarantees (e.g. [constrained decoding](https://github.com/dottxt-ai/outlines), [Minimo](https://github.com/gpoesia/minimo), [AlphaProof](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/), [FunSearch](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6), [VerMCTS](https://github.com/namin/llm-verified-with-monte-carlo-tree-search), [Scallop](https://www.scallop-lang.org/), [Iterative Reasoning through Energy Diffusion](https://energy-based-model.github.io/ired/), [continuously relaxed machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06640)).

As a student in the class, you will present a neurosymbolic paper of your choice. At the end of the semester, you will pursue a final project, where you flesh out your own idea from design to implementation. To warm up, we will also each implement a common assignment.
