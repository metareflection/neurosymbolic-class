# Neurosymbolic Programming

The topic for CS2520R Fall 2025 is Neurosymbolic Programming.
We will examine how neural networks can synthesize and evaluate formal logic proofs, constraint satisfaction problems, and programs that preserve syntax and semantics with both hard and probabilistic guarantees using specialized architectures, loss functions and higher organizations (e.g. constrained decoding, [Minimo](https://github.com/gpoesia/minimo)/AlphaProof/FunSearch, [VerMCTS](https://github.com/namin/llm-verified-with-monte-carlo-tree-search), Scallop, IRED, relaxed machines, etc.).

As a student in the class, you will present a neurosymbolic paper of your choice. At the end of the semester, you will pursue a final project, where you flesh out your own idea from design to implementation. To warm up, we will also each implement a common assignment.
