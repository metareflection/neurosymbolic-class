## Homework

Your homework is due **October 16**. [You can find the assignment here in the form of a Google Colab notebook.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ywnr7BM6MdH25XdWZnXlGPfZBGe6r6Tw) You will need to log into your Google Workspace account to save your changes.

In this assignment, you will explore examples of neuro-symbolic AI. The first example is the composition of an LLM and verifier in a loop to discover proofs. You will also explore how to constrain the output of LLMs with logical instead of statistical guarantees.

If you get stuck on any question, don't hesitate to reach out to the TF, Matthew Retchin, for guidance.
