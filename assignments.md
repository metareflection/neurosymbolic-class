# Assignments

## Assignment: Implement a given semantic model

Here is a semantic model for dependent types. TODO: I will provide the formal semantics as a PDF, and maybe LaTeX.

Implement this model in the language/system of your choice.

Explain any deviation from the model.

### Some resources for understanding and implementing dependent types

- _A tutorial implementation of a dependently typed lambda calculus_ ([PDF](https://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/LambdaPi.pdf)) by L&ouml;h, McBride, Swierstra (2001).
- TODO: collectively add more resources.
