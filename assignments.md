## Assignment: Implement a given semantic model

Here is a semantic model for dependent types. TODO: I will provide the formal semantics as a PDF, and maybe LaTeX.

Implement this model in the language/system of your choice.

Explain any deviation from the model.

### Some resources for understanding and implementing dependent types

- _A tutorial implementation of a dependently typed lambda calculus_ ([PDF](https://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/LambdaPi.pdf)) by L&ouml;h, McBride, Swierstra (2001).
- _pi-forall_ ([notes](https://github.com/sweirich/pi-forall/blob/2023/doc/oplss.pdf), [code](https://github.com/sweirich/pi-forall)) by Stephanie Weirich (2023).
- David Christiansen, co-author of [_The Little Typer_](https://thelittletyper.com/) with Daniel P. Friedman, has some [tutorials around programming language implementations](https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/), including _Checking Dependent Types with Bidirectional Type Checking and NbE (Normalization by Evaluation)_ -- [Haskell version PDF (2019)](https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/implementing-types-hs.pdf).
- TODO: collectively add more resources.
