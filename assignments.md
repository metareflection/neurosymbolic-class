## Homework

Your homework is due **October 17**. [You can find the assignment here in the form of a Google Colab notebook.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ywnr7BM6MdH25XdWZnXlGPfZBGe6r6Tw) You will need to log into your Harvard Google Workspace account to save your changes.

In this assignment, you will explore examples of neuro-symbolic AI. The first example is the composition of an LLM and verifier in a loop to discover proofs. You will also explore how to constrain the output of LLMs with logical instead of statistical guarantees.

For discussion questions, you may use $\LaTeX$ via pairs of dollar signs (e.g., `$a = b$` becomes $a = b$). You may also write your answers on [Overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com/) if you wish and submit a separate PDF.

If you get stuck on any question, don't hesitate to reach out to the TF, Matthew Retchin, for guidance.
